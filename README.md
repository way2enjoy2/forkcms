# Fork CMS Compression Module

## Description
The Fork CMS Compression module let's you compress PNG & JPG images on your website. Use this module to shrink images on your site so they will use **less bandwidth and your website will load faster**. The compression module uses the free API of [Way2Enjoy](https://Way2Enjoy.com/) .

## Preview
Backend + statistics:



I did the test with 3 images (3264x2448 resolution) taken from my camera. I uploaded and inserted the photos on a Fork CMS page and used the compression module. I went from 8.2MB to 1.5MB for the three images together!

## Installation

1. Upload the `/src/Backend/Modules/Compression` folder to your `/src/Backend/Modules` folder.
3. Browse to your Fork CMS backend.
4. Go to `Settings > Modules`. Click on the install button next to the Comprossion module in the uninstalled list.
5. Go to `Settings > Modules > Compression` to use it.

## How to use it

1. Get a free API key (500 images/month for free) [here](https://way2enjoy.com/developers)
2. Go to `Settings > Modules > Compression` and enter your API key
3. In the tree structure, choose a few folders with images to compress. Press save. Then press the execute button to start compression.
4. Use a cronjob if you want to compress these images once in a while, or press the execute button to compress the images on the fly.

Note: We store a history of compressed files in the database with a checksum. By doing that, we can ignore files that already have been compressed and ignore them when a new compression task starts.
